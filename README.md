A form generator following conventions in [WordPress short codes](https://github.com/MWDelaney/bootstrap-3-shortcodes)

Goals:

* make it return the original markup
* make it return before/after change
* make a submit() method to send it somewhere
* make an "onComplete" feedback - green/red checkmark/x
*
